This is a wrapper that watches stdout and stderr of the launched command
for activity. If there's no activity for a given time, the command
is interrupted and restarted up to a given number of retries if possible,
otherwise it is killed.

Currently the /proc filesystem is required (so this works on Linux and Cygwin).
