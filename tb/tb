tb : tinderbox script for libreoffice
=====================================

tb is a script to run un-attended build on multiple repos, for multiple branches
and for gerrit patch review system.

tb has two main mode of operation. a tinderbox (tb) mode and a gerrit mode.
It can also operate in 'dual' mode, doing both tb and gerrit mode.

In 'tb' mode, tb monitor a certain number of defined 'branches' for new commits.
When one or more new commits are detected on a monitored branches
tb initiate a build on that branch and typically inform a tinderbox-server
of the result of that build.

In 'gerrit' mode, tb poll a buildbot gerrit plugin for new patch to test build.
when such a task is found, tb checkout the patch concerned, test build it and
report the result to gerrit.

In 'dual' mode, tb alternate between the tb and gerrit mode. In dual mode
there is 3 diffrent scheduling mode:
The 'fair' mode, which try  tb and gerrit
build alternatively.
The tb-gerrit mode, in which tb does primarily tb build unless there is no such
build to do, in which case it does gerrit build until a new tb build is needed
The gerrit-tb mode, in which tb does primarily gerrit build unless there is no
ssuch build to do, in which case it does tb build until a new gerrit build is
needed.

tb configuration is organized in 'profile' which contains configuration for
one or more 'branches' to monitor.
tb can only run one profile at the time, but monitor and can therefore build
any of the branches configured under that profile.

The configuration is organized as:

  ~/.tb/config
       /meta/
       /phases.sh
       /profiles/<profile_name>/autogen.lastrun
       /profiles/<profile_name>/autogen.lastrun_gerrit
       /profiles/<profile_name>/autogen.lastrun_tb
       /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/autogen.lastrun
       /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/autogen.lastrun_gerrit
       /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/autogen.lastrun_tb
       /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/config
       /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/config_gerrit
       /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/config_tb
       /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/false_negatives
       /profiles/<profile_name>/config
       /profiles/<profile_name>/false_negatives
       /profiles/<profile_name>/phases.sh

The configuration is obtained for a given branche by sourcing, in this order,

~/tb/config
    /profiles/<profile_name>/config
    /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/config
and
    /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/config_tb
for tb-build, or
    /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/config_gerrit
for gerrit-build.

Each build need a autogen configuration for the building of libreoffice.
for a branch the autogen configuration to is is the _first_ found of

for tb-build :
    /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/autogen.lastrun_tb
    /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/autogen.lastrun
    /profiles/<profile_name>/autogen.lastrun_tb
    /profiles/<profile_name>/autogen.lastrun

for gerrit-build:
    /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/autogen.lastrun_gerrit
    /profiles/<profile_name>/branches/<branch_name>/autogen.lastrun
    /profiles/<profile_name>/autogen.lastrun_gerrit
    /profiles/<profile_name>/autogen.lastrun

Note: Contrary to config for tb itself, autogen config do not aggregate.
The first file found according to the rules above is then the entire
configuration that will be use as autogen.lastrun for the build.

Some tb configuration parameters can be specified at the global level 'G',
some at the profile level 'P' and some at the branch level 'B'.
Unless otherwise specified a parameter can be specificed at any level.
If a parameter is specified at multiple level then the lowest level prevail.
In other words: B prevail over P, which prevail over G.

The following variables can be specified in tb's configuration files.

                for information on how to acquire such an ID.
TB_LOGFILE=<path> File where tb will log message about it's operation.
                  The file does not have to exist, but the path containing the file must.
                  This is only for message issued by tb itself.. this does no relate to build
                  logs.
TB_MATADATA_DIR<path> directory where tb will store state information regarding the defferent
                      branches it monitor. In tb mode, tb is keeping track of the last
                      sucessfull build point, in order to be able to notify the committers
                      involved in patches since that point in case of build failure.
                      tb also keep track of the last time it uploaded a version
                      when such upload options is specified.
                      All the files used to keep track of theses are store in this directory,
                      tb will attempt to create the directory if it does not exist
                      This is G or P-level parameter only
                      This paramter is mandatory.
TB_NAME=<name> Name of the tinderbox. see http://wiki/documentfoundation.org/Development/Tinderbox
               for naming conventions.
               This is G or P-level parameter only
               This paramter is mandatory.
TB_NICE=<prefix> Value to prepend to expensive command like MAKE to nice it
                 for eacmpel TB_NICE="nice ionice -c3"
TB_OWNER=<email> Email of the owner/operator of the tinderbox
                 This is G or P-level parameter only
                 This paramter is mandatory.
TB_POLL_DELAY=<num_of_seconds> Delay in second between two attempt to pool the states of branches.
TB_POST_BUILD_DELAY=<num_of_seconds> Pause in second after a build.
TB_SMTP_HOST=<smtp_hostname> Hostname of the smtp server to use to send email.
                             This paramter is mandatory in tb mode

TB_SMTP_PASSWORD=<password> Password associated with TB_SMTP_USER.
                            This paramter is mandatory if TB_SMTP_USER is specified
TB_SMTP_USER=<username> Username to login to the smtp server.
                        If your smtp server does not require authotification, you can omit this.
TB_TINDERBOX_BRANCH=<name> Name assocaited witha  branch on the tibderbox server.
                           The tinderbox server need to have a branch name assocaited with any
                           build repport. the server only recognize a preset list of such name
                           and they do not necessarely match you local branch name.
                           This is a tb-mode only paramter. This is ignored in gerrit mode

In general, when a command line argument influence on of the paramter listed
above, it can only override a G-level specification. P-level take, for the most
part precedence of the command-line, and B-level always take precedence.

The rational is that tb is meant to be a un-attended long running job, Ideally
taking no argument what-so-ever except -p <profile_name> and possibly --mode=


Note for tinbuild2 user: tb does _not_ require a primer build. but it will not
send email to committers in case a failure until it has had a prior sucessful
build for a given branch.
