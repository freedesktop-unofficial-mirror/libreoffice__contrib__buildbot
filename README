Howto setup a tinderbox
=======================

Prepare your build tree from git as described here:

http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Native_Build

Configure your build, *do* a build (if necessary, fix the build),
tweak your setup to get optimal performance (play with
--with-num-cpus, use ccache etc.)

After a successful build, 'cd' into the source tree (the same dir that
also has the autogen.sh and configure scripts), and run tinbuild.

A typical call for a home box (without a working smtp relay) looks
like this:

tinbuild -m joe_hacker@gmail.com -s smtp.gmail.com -u joe_hacker -p SeCrEt -c tls -t "My Home Tinderbox Linux gcc-4.4.1 (x86_64)"

If you don't want the user or password to show up in the process list,
simply edit the tinbuild script - rather at the top of it, there are
SMTPUSER and SMTPPW variables, to be set.

This setup will then continuously build the tree (whenever there are
new commits), and send results to the tinderbox master, as well as
complaint mails to the committers that broke the build. To prevent
excessive spam, you'll get a Bcc of those nag mails - so you'll
notice.
