A small script to create gcov/lcov code coverage reports of tests run
on the libreoffice source code.


Usage: lcov-report.sh [-b] -c [FILE] -s [DIRECTORY] -t [DIRECTORY] -w [DIRECTORY]


-s
        Specify the location where the libreoffice source code is
        located. This flag is mandatory.

-c
        Specify the file containing the libreoffice test commands to run.
        In it's simplest form, this file could contain a single line
        reading something like 'cd $SRCDIR && make check'. This flag
        is mandatory.

-b
        Specifies to build the libreoffice sources in the location
        specified by the '-s' flag. This flag is optional. If you
        choose to omit it, you must make sure the libreoffice source
        code is built using the appropriate FLAGS ('-fprofile-arcs
        -ftest-coverage').

-t
        Specifies the directory in which to contain the lcov
        tracefile's. This flag is mandatory.

-w
        Specifies the directory in which to contain the generated HTML
        report files. This flag is mandatory.
