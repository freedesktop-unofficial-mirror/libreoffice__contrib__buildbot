lcov-report.sh

	A small script to create gcov/lcov code coverage reports of tests run
	on the libreoffice source code.


Usage: lcov-report.sh [-a|-b|-c] -s [DIRECTORY] -t [DIRECTORY] -w [DIRECTORY]


-b
        Run lcov commands before you run your tests. This creates a
        baseline lcov tracefile. You can only supply one of '-a', '-b'
        or '-c' simultaneously.

-a
        Run lcov commands after you run your tests. This creates a
        tracefile that contains the resukts of your tests, and combines
        it with the baseline. You can only supply one of '-a', '-b' or
        '-c' simultaneously.

-c
        Specifies to build the libreoffice sources in the location
        specified by the '-s' flag. This flag is optional. If you
        choose to omit it, you must make sure the libreoffice source
        code is built using the appropriate FLAGS ('-fprofile-arcs
        -ftest-coverage'). You can only supply one of '-a', '-b' or
        '-c' simultaneously.

-s
        Specify the location where the libreoffice source code is
        located. This flag is mandatory.

-t
        Specifies the directory in which to contain the lcov
        tracefile's. This flag is mandatory.

-w
        Specifies the directory in which to contain the generated HTML
        report files. This flag is mandatory.
